# Smart_Motor_with_WIO
Smart Motors are pre-programmed, trainable motors that can be trained to move to different positions or speeds in response to different sensor inputs. They can be integrated with locally available materials, like sticks, paper, and cardboard, to be used as a tool for engineering and storytelling. This DIY innovation fits perfectly with Novel Engineering, an educational technique, developed at Tufts CEEO, that integrates the idea of project-based design engineering with literacy and reading in the classroom.
The inbuilt buzzer of Wio Terminal is used to provide audible feedback and the colorful screen is used to communicate various states of the system. The goal is to make the UI user-friendly and language agnostic by using pictorial instructions. The availability of the screen also meant we could show users the data in a graphical way for them to make sense of their systemâ€™s state and behavior.
